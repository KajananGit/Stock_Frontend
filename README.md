## Project Description
This project utilised Javascript, React, HTML and CSS to build a frontend for supermarket stock management database. 
This frontend builds on a backend API for a fictional warehouse which contains stock batches of particular items. Products in stock can be chosen and sorted into a list of ordered items, that is then added to an order placed by a supermarket.
